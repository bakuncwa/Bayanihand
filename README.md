# Bayanihand – Uplifting Handyman Work

### Project Description
**Top 5 UN SDG 8 – Decent Work and Economic Growth application** at the UP Society of Computer Scientists HACKathon 2024, achieving a **perfect score in the technical rubric**.  

• Developed as a **C#/.NET prototype web application** utilizing **EntityFramework** and **MySQL** for backend development.  
• Created **two user perspectives**:
  - **Handyman:** Commission view and referral reports based on completed services, including schedule, hourly rate (minimum wage + materials + service charge), request details, and payment mode.
  - **Customer:** Rate handyman performance, with ratings contributing to a referral system.

---

## Problem Statement
- **Poverty & Income Inequality:** 18.1% of the Philippine population lives below the national poverty line (ADB, 2021). Tax-to-GDP optimization is low (~75%) and government aid is insufficient.
- **High Barriers in Formal Employment:** Many low-wage roles have unrealistic educational requirements, limiting upward mobility.
- **Informal Economy Contribution:** 70% of the population and 1/3rd of GDP is attributed to informal economy work (UP, 2022). Jobs include housekeeping, carpentry, dispatch, and other handymen roles.
- **Key Dilemma:** Lack of visibility and recognition for informal handyman jobs limits legitimate economic participation.

---

## Objectives
1. **Increase visibility and legitimization** of handyman services.
2. **Expand job opportunities** in barangay and metropolitan areas.
3. **Improve accessibility** for a wide income range of clients.
4. **Provide dual user perspectives:** handyman commission/referral reports and customer ratings.

## Relevance to SDG 8
- 74.6% of households in NCR have internet access, 81.7% via mobile phones (Philippine Statistics Authority, 2023).
- The platform helps legitimize informal work as **decent, productive work**.
- Survey of 51 respondents shows **positive correlation** (Spearman’s Rs = 0.338) between openness to handyman services and collectivistic behavior in Filipino communities.
